Personal Expense Tracker

This Personal Expense Tracker is a Python-based command-line application that helps users log, view, edit, and delete their expenses. All data is stored in a CSV file (expenses.csv), making it lightweight and easy to manage.

Features

Add Expense: Record new expenses with fields for date, amount, category, and description.

View All Expenses: Display a list of all recorded expenses.

Edit Expense: Update an existing expense's details (e.g., date, amount, category, or description).

Delete Expense: Remove an expense by its index.

CSV-Based Storage: Data is persisted in a CSV file, ensuring it is available even after restarting the application.

Add an expense (e.g., 2024-12-01, 50.0, Food, Groceries).

View all expenses to verify it was added.

Edit an expense to correct any mistakes.

Delete an expense if it's no longer needed.

Exit the program.

File Details

expenses.csv: The file where all expense data is stored. Each row contains:

Date: The date of the expense (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD).

Amount: The amount spent (e.g., 50.0).

Category: The category of the expense (e.g., Food).

Description: A short description of the expense (e.g., Groceries).

Script Functions:

initialize_file: Ensures the CSV file exists and creates it if not.

add_expense: Adds a new expense to the CSV file.

Notes

The program uses zero-based indexing when referencing expenses.

Make sure to provide valid inputs (e.g., numeric amounts, valid dates) to avoid errors.

Future Enhancements

Add support for data visualization (e.g., spending charts by category or time).

Implement user authentication for multi-user functionality.

Allow filtering expenses by date or category.

Integrate a database (e.g., SQLite) for more robust data management.
